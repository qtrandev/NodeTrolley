Trolley tracking from Node JS server.  
Worked in conjunction with https://github.com/CodeForFtL/trolley-tracker.  
This code is placed at https://github.com/CodeForFtL/trolley-tracker/tree/master/client.  

The trolley-tracker Node JS server is deployed in demo mode at http://trolleytracking.herokuapp.com and Code for FTL is now absorbed into Code for Miami/Code for South.
